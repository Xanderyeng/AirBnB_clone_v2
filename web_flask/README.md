# Repository Title Goes Here

Application of Flask. Web framework for make more dynamic our HBNB.
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.

By now, the purpose of web frameworks should be clear: to hide the boilerplate and infrastructural code related to handling HTTP requests and responses. Just how much is hidden depends on the framework. Django and Flask represent two extremes. Django includes something for every situation, almost to its detriment. Flask bills itself as a "micro-framework" and handles the bare minimum of web application functionality, relying on third-party packages to do some of the less common web framework tasks.

Remember, though, that at the end of the day, Python web frameworks all work the same way: they receive HTTP requests, dispatch code that generates HTML, and creates an HTTP response with that content. In fact, all major server-side frameworks work in this way (excluding JavaScript frameworks). Hopefully, you're now equipped to choose between frameworks as you understand their purpose.
